# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This project will be making calls to the Foursquare API to pull location data, and using the data to create meaningful business insights and geospatial visualizations

# Introduciton/Identifying a Business Problem
The corporate office of a growing chain of coffee shops is looking to expand. They plan to open a new store in Chicago, IL, but cannot determine the most optimal location for their new store. The goal of this project will be to identify the most optimal location for a new coffee shop based on trends in location data.

# Data
I will call the Foursqaure API to fetch this data. All of my analysis will be based on indicators driven from the Foursqaure dataset. Some factors to keep in mind when selecting what data to use in analysis for this use case:

1. Number of competing coffee shops in each area (we will use zip codes).
2. Type of attractions adjacent to established, successful coffee shops.
